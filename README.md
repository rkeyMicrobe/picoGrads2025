## Analysis Scripts

This repository includes 12 R scripts forming a custom, multi-step pipeline for amplicon sequence analysis (using phyloseq), multivariate mixed linear modeling (sommer), and network inference (WGCNA, SpiecEasi).

**How to run:**

- Start with `01_qiime2.R`

- Proceed step-by-step through each numbered script up to `12_speicEasiAnalysis.R`

‚ö†Ô∏è For`10_wgcnaPowerTest.R` ‚Äî re-run this script for each power value you wish to test (power = ??)

Simple and reproducible: As long as the required inputs for `01_qiime2.R` are in place, you can generate all dataframes, figures, and tables used in the manuscript.


There are 12 .R scripts in total and are contained in this project folder. This is custom build multi-step pipeline for amplicon sequencing analysis using *phyloseq*, multivariate mixed linear models using *sommer*, and network inference using *WGCNA* and *SpeicEasi* packages. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out!

## ‚öôRequirements & Installation

This project was developed using **2025.08.0 Build 135** "Cucumberleaf Sunflower"

‚ö†Ô∏è It is recommended to run these scripts in R-Studio! 

Below is the full list of R packages used in this pipeline:

**Core tidy & plotting:**  
`tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `scales`, `reshape2`, `ggpubr`, `cowplot`, `RColorBrewer`, `viridis`, `ggrepel`, `ggforce`, `ggvenn`, `patchwork`

**Data tables & summaries:**  
`feather`, `flextable`, `gt`, `skimr`

**Ecological & statistical analyses:**  
`vegan`, `phyloseq`, `WGCNA`, `SpiecEasi`, `sommer`, `compositions`, `bestNormalize`, `igraph`, `Matrix`

**Mapping:**  
`maps`, `mapproj`

## Data Availability

Due to Github file size limits, raw and processed sequencing data are hosted externally:  
- Processed dataframes: Zenodo link Coming soon! :) 
- Raw amplicon dataframes: NCBI link coming soon!
- Or contact the authors for `01_qiime2.R` input files.

This repository contains scripts only. **The total size after running everything is 5.1GB!**
